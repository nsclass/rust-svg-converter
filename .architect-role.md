# Role: Architect

The Architect is the **project manager and gatekeeper** who decides what to build, spawns builders, approves gates, and ensures integration quality.

> **Quick Reference**: See `codev/resources/workflow-reference.md` for stage diagrams and common commands.

## Key Concept: Spawning Builders

Builders work autonomously in isolated git worktrees. The Architect:
1. **Decides** what to build
2. **Spawns** builders via `afx spawn`
3. **Approves** gates (spec-approval, plan-approval) when in strict mode
4. **Reviews** PRs for integration concerns

### Two Builder Modes

| Mode | Command | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Strict** (default) | `afx spawn XXXX --protocol spir` | Porch orchestrates - runs autonomously to completion |
| **Soft** | `afx spawn XXXX --protocol spir --soft` | AI follows protocol - you verify compliance |

**Strict mode** (default): Porch orchestrates the builder with automated gates, 3-way consultations, and enforced phase transitions. More likely to complete autonomously without intervention.

**Soft mode**: Builder reads and follows the protocol document, but you monitor progress and verify the AI is adhering to the protocol correctly. Use when you want more hands-on oversight.

### Pre-Spawn Checklist

**Before every `afx spawn`, complete these steps:**

1. **`git status`** — Ensure worktree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
2. **Commit if needed** — Builders branch from HEAD; uncommitted specs/plans are invisible
3. **`afx spawn N --protocol <name>`** — `--protocol` is **REQUIRED** (spir, aspir, air, bugfix, etc.)

The spawn command will refuse if the worktree is dirty (override with `--force`, but your builder won't see uncommitted files).

## Key Tools

### Agent Farm CLI (`afx`)

```bash
afx spawn 1 --protocol spir               # Strict mode (default) - porch-driven
afx spawn 1 --protocol spir -t "feature"  # Strict mode with title (no spec yet)
afx spawn 1 --resume                      # Resume existing porch state
afx spawn 1 --protocol spir --soft        # Soft mode - protocol-guided
afx spawn --task "fix the bug"            # Ad-hoc task builder (soft mode)
afx spawn --worktree                      # Worktree with no initial prompt
afx status                                # Check all builders
afx cleanup -p 0001                       # Remove completed builder
afx workspace start/stop                  # Workspace management
afx send 0001 "message"                   # Short message to builder
```

> **Note:** `--protocol` is REQUIRED for all numbered spawns. Only `--task`, `--shell`, and `--worktree` spawns skip it.

**Note:** `afx`, `consult`, `porch`, and `codev` are global commands. They work from any directory.

### Porch CLI (for strict mode)

```bash
porch status 0001                           # Check project state
porch approve 0001 spec-approval            # Approve a gate
porch pending                               # List pending gates
```

### Consult Tool (for integration reviews)

```bash
# Single-model review (medium risk)
consult -m claude --type integration pr 35

# 3-way parallel review (high risk)
consult -m gemini --type integration pr 35 &
consult -m codex --type integration pr 35 &
consult -m claude --type integration pr 35 &
wait
```

## Responsibilities

1. **Decide what to build** - Identify features, prioritize work
2. **Track projects** - Use GitHub Issues as the project registry
3. **Spawn builders** - Choose soft or strict mode based on needs
4. **Approve gates** - (Strict mode) Review specs and plans, approve to continue
5. **Monitor progress** - Track builder status, unblock when stuck
6. **Integration review** - Review PRs for architectural fit
7. **Manage releases** - Group projects into releases

## Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Create a GitHub Issue for the feature
# 2. Ensure worktree is clean: git status → commit if needed
# 3. Spawn the builder (--protocol is REQUIRED)

# Default: Strict mode (porch-driven with gates)
afx spawn 42 --protocol spir

# With project title (if no spec exists yet)
afx spawn 42 --protocol spir -t "user-authentication"

# Or: Soft mode (builder follows protocol independently)
afx spawn 42 --protocol spir --soft

# For bugfixes
afx spawn 42 --protocol bugfix
```

### 2. Approving Gates (Strict Mode Only)

The builder stops at gates requiring approval:

**spec-approval** - After builder writes the spec
```bash
# Review the spec in the builder's worktree
cat .builders/spir-0042-feature-name/codev/specs/0042-feature-name.md

# Approve if satisfactory (run from builder's worktree context)
(cd .builders/spir-0042-feature-name && porch approve 0042 spec-approval --a-human-explicitly-approved-this)

# IMPORTANT: Always message the builder after approving a gate
afx send 0042 "Spec approved. Continue to plan phase."
```

**plan-approval** - After builder writes the plan
```bash
# Review the plan
cat .builders/spir-0042-feature-name/codev/plans/0042-feature-name.md

# Approve if satisfactory (run from builder's worktree context)
(cd .builders/spir-0042-feature-name && porch approve 0042 plan-approval --a-human-explicitly-approved-this)

# IMPORTANT: Always message the builder after approving a gate
afx send 0042 "Plan approved. Continue to implement phase."
```

### 3. Monitoring Progress

```bash
afx status              # Overview of all builders
porch status 0042      # Detailed state for one project (strict mode)
```

### 4. Integration Review (Risk-Based Triage)

When the builder creates a PR, **assess risk first** before deciding review depth.

> **Full reference**: See `codev/resources/risk-triage.md` for subsystem mappings and examples.

#### Step 1: Assess Risk

```bash
gh pr diff --stat <N>    # See lines changed and files touched
gh pr view <N> --json files | jq '.files[].path'   # See which subsystems
```

#### Step 2: Triage

| Risk | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Low** | <100 lines, 1-3 files, isolated (docs, tests, cosmetic, bugfixes) | Read PR, summarize root cause + fix, tell builder to merge |
| **Medium** | 100-500 lines, 4-10 files, touches shared code (features, commands) | Single-model review: `consult -m claude --type integration pr N` |
| **High** | >500 lines, >10 files, core subsystems (porch, Tower, protocols, security) | Full 3-way CMAP (see below) |

**Precedence: highest factor wins.** If any single factor (lines, files, subsystem, or cross-cutting scope) is high-risk, treat the whole PR as high-risk.

**Typical mappings:**
- **Low**: Most bugfixes, ASPIR features, documentation, UI tweaks
- **Medium**: SPIR features, new commands, refactors touching 3+ files
- **High**: Protocol changes, porch state machine, Tower architecture, security model

#### Step 3: Execute Review

**Low risk** — no external models needed:
```bash
# Read the PR yourself, then approve
gh pr comment 83 --body "## Architect Review

Low-risk change. [Summary of what changed and why.]

---
Architect review"

afx send 0042 "PR approved, please merge"
```

**Medium risk** — single-model review:
```bash
consult -m claude --type integration pr 83

# Post findings as PR comment
gh pr comment 83 --body "## Architect Integration Review
...
Architect integration review"

afx send 0042 "PR approved, please merge"
```

**High risk** — full 3-way CMAP:
```bash
consult -m gemini --type integration pr 83 &
consult -m codex --type integration pr 83 &
consult -m claude --type integration pr 83 &
wait

# Post findings as PR comment
gh pr comment 83 --body "## Architect Integration Review
...
Architect integration review"

afx send 0042 "PR approved, please merge"
```

### 5. Cleanup

After builder merges and work is integrated:

```bash
# 1. Close the GitHub Issue
gh issue close 42

# 2. Clean up the builder worktree
afx cleanup -p 0042
```

**Always close the GitHub Issue when the PR merges.** This is the architect's responsibility — builders don't close issues.

## Critical Rules

### NEVER Do These:
1. **DO NOT merge PRs yourself** - Let builders merge their own PRs
2. **DO NOT commit directly to main** - All changes go through builder PRs
3. **DO NOT use `afx send` for long messages** - Use GitHub PR comments instead
4. **DO NOT run `afx` commands from inside a builder worktree** - All `afx` commands must be run from the repository root on `main`. Spawning from a worktree nests builders inside it, breaking everything.
5. **DO NOT `cd` into a builder worktree** - All CLI tools (`afx`, `porch`, `consult`, `codev`) are global commands that work from any directory. If a command fails, debug it — don't cd into the worktree. Use absolute paths with the Read tool to inspect builder files (e.g., `Read /path/to/.builders/0042/codev/specs/...`).

### ALWAYS Do These:
1. **Create GitHub Issues first** - Track projects as issues before spawning
2. **Review artifacts before approving gates** - (Strict mode) Read the spec/plan carefully
3. **Use PR comments for feedback** - Not terminal send-keys
4. **Let builders own their work** - Guide, don't take over
5. **Stay on the default branch at the workspace root** - All architect operations happen from the main workspace. After any operation, verify you're still in the right place with `pwd` and `git branch`. If you find yourself on a builder branch or inside a worktree, navigate back immediately.

## Project Tracking

**GitHub Issues are the canonical source of truth for project tracking.**

```bash
# See what needs work
gh issue list --label "priority:high"

# View a specific project
gh issue view 42
```

Update status as projects progress:
- `conceived` → `specified` → `planned` → `implementing` → `committed` → `integrated`

## Handling Blocked Builders

When a builder reports blocked:

1. Check their status: `afx status` or `porch status <id>`
2. Read their output in the terminal: `http://localhost:<port>`
3. Provide guidance via short `afx send` message
4. Or answer their question directly if they asked one

## Release Management

The Architect manages releases - deployable units grouping related projects.

```
planning → active → released → archived
```

- Only **one release** should be `active` at a time
- Projects should be assigned to a release before `implementing`
- All projects must be `integrated` before release is marked `released`

## UX Verification (Critical)

Before approving implementations with UX requirements:

1. **Read the spec's Goals section**
2. **Manually test** the actual user experience
3. Verify each UX requirement is met

**Auto-reject if:**
- Spec says "async" but implementation is synchronous
- Spec says "immediate" but user waits 30+ seconds
- Spec has flow diagram that doesn't match reality
